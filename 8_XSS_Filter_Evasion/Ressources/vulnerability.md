When clicking on the NSA image, we arrive on a page with "File: nsa_prism.jpg" written.  
The url is http://192.168.56.103/?page=media&src=nsa and we see in the inspector that we have a <object> object, with "data" having a link to the image in value.  

The URL has a src=nsa in parameter. It is actually putting the nsa image in the data attribute of the <object> object.

Data URIs allow HTML tags to be created with inline content, rather than reaching out to and making an additional request to the server.
Data URLs are composed of four parts: a prefix (data:), a MIME type indicating the type of data, an optional base64 token if non-textual, and the data itself:  
> data:[<mediatype>][;base64],<data>  

data:text/html;base64, + "<script>alert("Hello")</script>

We can use base64 encoding in the case of a system that blocks specific strings like “script” or symbols like parentheses. This method can be used to disguise the payload and evade the protections. 

Encoding <script>alert("Hello")</script> in base 64 -> PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiSGVsbG8iKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==


http://192.168.56.103/?page=media&src=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgiSGVsbG8iKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==


We can prevent it by loading images from a database rather than a link to it
