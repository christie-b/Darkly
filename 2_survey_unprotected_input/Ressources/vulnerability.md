On the survey page, we can grade several persons from 1 to 10.  
By inspecting the page, we see that we can change the values, and put 42 instead of 10 for instance.  

By changing the value and giving someone the grade of 42, we get the flag  
`03A944B434D5BAFF05F46C4BEDE5792551A2595574BCAFC9A6E25F67C382CCAA`  

This could lead to datas that do not make sense, which can be important when analyzing data for instance.  
To prevent this, input validation should be done, before treating the data.
