On the website footer, there are redirections to social medias (facebook, twitter, instagram).  
When we inspect the redirection, we can see this:  
```
href="index.php?page=redirect&site=facebook"
```
If we change the redirection to another address, we can see that redirections are not safe.
Malicious persons can launch a phishing campaign, with a redirection to their url, and retrieve sensitive information, if the potential victim didn't pay attention to the address he was redirected to.


How to prevent this:  
- Avoid using redirects  
- Do not allow the URL as user input for the destination  
- If it must be an input, verify the redirection address, with a list of authorized URLs for example.
