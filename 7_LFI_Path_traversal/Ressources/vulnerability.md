A path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder.  
By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files.

UNIX etc/passwd is a common file used to demonstrate directory traversal, as it is often used by crackers to try cracking the passwords.

gives us the flag.



To prevent this:
- Validate the user input before processing it, whitelist or only alphanumeric characters.  
- Verify that the path entered starts with the expected base directory
